## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A simple but effective website for a local business trying to upgrade their web presence, made accordingly to the costumer likings and budget.

## Optimizations
It is based on a Html5 template, because the budget that this business was working with was tight, so a website from scratch could be a big improvement.



## Lessons Learned:

Its always good to work with different costumers, as it helps you improve in different areas, with this one i learned how to manage smaller budgets and deadlines.
